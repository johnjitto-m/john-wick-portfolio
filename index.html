          <h3>My Code of Conduct</h3>
          <p>
            Every contract is a promiseâ€”a sacred, unbreakable vow. The business
            is cold, but the discipline is absolute. Honor is a currency more
            valuable than gold, and every debt must be paid in full.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not seek chaos, but I do not shy away from it. I am a restorer
            of balance in a world that has lost its way. My actions are swift,
            precise, and final.
